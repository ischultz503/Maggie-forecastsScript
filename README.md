# Maggie-forecastsScript
these are of the files Maggie gave me for pulling past forecasts. 

-mems specify the members (models) you want to pull. 
-the wpVerif file pecifies stations (only the 4 digit station ID in the 4th column needs to be changed).
-get_fcst calls all of the other scripts and is the only one that needs to be exectued. It takes a start and end date: YYYYMMDD.
-get-fcst-oper-all does all of the heavy lifting but theoretically doesn't need to be touched.
